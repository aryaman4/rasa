```
BOT: What am I looking at?
```
```
USER: Rasa Core is a dialogue engine for building AI assistants.
```
```
USER: It's part of the open source Rasa framework.
```
```
BOT: What's cool about it?
```
```
USER: Rather than a bunch of if/else statements, it uses a machine learning model trained on example conversations to decide what to do next.
```
```
BOT: That sounds harder than writing a few if statements.
```
```
USER: In the beginning of a project, it seems easier to just hard-code some logic.
```
```
USER: Rasa helps you when you want to go past that and create a bot that can handle more complexity.
This <a href="https://medium.com/rasa-blog/a-new-approach-to-conversational-software-2e64a5d05f2a" target="_blank">blog post</a> explains the philosophy behind Rasa Core.
```
```
BOT: Can I see it in action?
```
```
USER: We thought you'd never ask!
```
```
USER: Head over to the <a href="../../user-guide/rasa-tutorial">Rasa Tutorial</a> for an interactive example.
