## Using Rasa’s HTTP API

:::note
The instructions below are relevant for configuring how a model is run
within a Docker container or for testing the HTTP API locally. If you
want to deploy your assistant to users, see [Deploying Your Rasa Assistant](/docs/user-guide/how-to-deploy#deploying-your-rasa-assistant).

:::

You can run a simple HTTP server that handles requests using your
trained Rasa model with:

```bash
rasa run -m models --enable-api --log-file out.log
```

All the endpoints this API exposes are documented in [HTTP API](/docs/api/http-api).

The different parameters are:

* `-m`: the path to the folder containing your Rasa model,

* `--enable-api`: enable this additional API, and

* `--log-file`: the path to the log file.

Rasa can load your model in three different ways:

1. Fetch the model from a server (see [Fetching Models from a Server](/docs/user-guide/configuring-http-api#server-fetch-from-server)), or

2. Fetch the model from a remote storage (see [Cloud Storage](/docs/user-guide/cloud-storage)).

3. Load the model specified via `-m` from your local storage system,

Rasa tries to load a model in the above mentioned order, i.e. it only tries to load your model from your local
storage system if no model server and no remote storage were configured.

:::caution
Make sure to secure your server, either by restricting access to the server (e.g. using firewalls), or
by enabling an authentication method: [Security Considerations](/docs/user-guide/configuring-http-api#server-security).

:::

:::note
If you are using custom actions, make sure your action server is
running (see [Start an Action Server](/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#run-action-server)). If your actions are running
on a different machine, or you aren’t using the Rasa SDK, make sure
to update your `endpoints.yml` file.

:::

:::note
If you start the server with an NLU-only model, not all the available endpoints
can be called. Be aware that some endpoints will return a 409 status code, as a trained
Core model is needed to process the request.

:::

:::note
By default, the HTTP server runs as a single process. You can change the number
of worker processes using the `SANIC_WORKERS` environment variable. It is
recommended that you set the number of workers to the number of available CPU cores
(check out the
[Sanic docs](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sanic/deploying.html#workers)
for more details). This will only work in combination with the
`RedisLockStore` (see [Lock Stores](/docs/api/lock-stores)).

### Fetching Models from a Server

You can configure the HTTP server to fetch models from another URL:

```bash
rasa run --enable-api --log-file out.log --endpoints my_endpoints.yml
```

The model server is specified in the endpoint configuration
(`my_endpoints.yml`), where you specify the server URL Rasa
regularly queries for zipped Rasa models:

```yaml
models:
  url: http://my-server.com/models/default@latest
  wait_time_between_pulls: 10   # [optional](default: 100)
```

:::note
If you want to pull the model just once from the server, set
`wait_time_between_pulls` to `None`.

:::

:::note
Your model server must provide zipped Rasa models, and have
`{"ETag": <model_hash_string>}` as one of its headers. Rasa will
only download a new model if this model hash has changed.

:::

Rasa sends requests to your model server with an `If-None-Match`
header that contains the current model hash. If your model server can
provide a model with a different hash from the one you sent, it should send it
in as a zip file with an `ETag` header containing the new hash. If not, Rasa
expects an empty response with a `204` or `304` status code.

An example request Rasa might make to your model server looks like this:

```bash
$ curl --header "If-None-Match: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e" http://my-server.com/models/default@latest
```

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="server-fetch-from-remote-storage"></a>

### Fetching Models from a Remote Storage

You can also configure the Rasa server to fetch your model from a remote storage:

```bash
rasa run -m 20190506-100418.tar.gz --enable-api --log-file out.log --remote-storage aws
```

The model will be downloaded and stored in a temporary directory on your local storage system.
For more information see [Cloud Storage](/docs/user-guide/cloud-storage).

## Configuring SSL / HTTPS

By default the Rasa server is using HTTP for its communication. To secure the
communication with SSL, you need to provide a valid certificate and the corresponding
private key file.

You can specify these files as part of the `rasa run` command:

```bash
rasa run --ssl-certificate myssl.crt --ssl-keyfile myssl.key
```

If you encrypted your keyfile with a password during creation, you need to add
this password to the command:

```bash
rasa run --ssl-certificate myssl.crt --ssl-keyfile myssl.key --ssl-password mypassword
```

## Security Considerations

We recommend to not expose the Rasa Server to the outside world, but
rather connect to it from your backend over a private connection (e.g.
between docker containers).

Nevertheless, there are two authentication methods built in:

**Token Based Auth:**

Pass in the token using `--auth-token thisismysecret` when starting
the server:

```bash
rasa run \
    -m models \
    --enable-api \
    --log-file out.log \
    --auth-token thisismysecret
```

Your requests should pass the token, in our case `thisismysecret`,
as a parameter:

```bash
$ curl -XGET localhost:5005/conversations/default/tracker?token=thisismysecret
```

**JWT Based Auth:**

Enable JWT based authentication using `--jwt-secret thisismysecret`.
Requests to the server need to contain a valid JWT token in
the `Authorization` header that is signed using this secret
and the `HS256` algorithm.

The token’s payload must contain an object under the `user` key,
which in turn must contain the `username` and `role` attributes.
If the `role` is `admin`, all endpoints are accessible.
If the `role` is `user`, endpoints with a `sender_id` parameter are only accessible
if the `sender_id` matches the payload’s `username` property.

```bash
rasa run \
    -m models \
    --enable-api \
    --log-file out.log \
    --jwt-secret thisismysecret
```

Your requests should have set a proper JWT header:

```text
"Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ"
                 "zdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIi"
                 "wiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.qdrr2_a7Sd80gmCWjnDomO"
                 "Gl8eZFVfKXA6jhncgRn-I"
```

The following is an example payload for a JWT token:

```json
{
    "user": {
        "username": "<sender_id>",
        "role": "user"
    }
}
```

To create and encode the token, you can use tools such as the [JWT Debugger](https://jwt.io/), or a Python module such as [PyJWT](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Endpoint Configuration

To connect Rasa to other endpoints, you can specify an endpoint
configuration within a YAML file.
Then run Rasa with the flag
`--endpoints <path to endpoint configuration.yml>`.

For example:

```bash
rasa run \
    --m <Rasa model> \
    --endpoints <path to endpoint configuration>.yml
```

:::note
You can use environment variables within configuration files by specifying them with `${name of environment variable}`.
These placeholders are then replaced by the value of the environment variable.
